### Data Cleaning & Standardization Using Excel

**Data Cleaning** refers to the process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in data to improve its quality. **Standardization** involves ensuring that data is consistent in format and representation. Here’s a brief summary of key steps and techniques for data cleaning and standardization using Excel:

1. **Remove Duplicates**: 
   - Use the **Remove Duplicates** feature in the Data tab to eliminate repeated entries.

2. **Handle Missing Values**: 
   - Identify and decide how to deal with missing data (e.g., fill with averages, remove rows, or leave as-is).

3. **Standardize Formats**:
   - Ensure consistent formats for dates, numbers, and text (e.g., using `TEXT` functions to format dates).
   - Convert text to a consistent case (e.g., using `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, or `PROPER()` functions).

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Set rules for data entry using **Data Validation** to prevent invalid data inputs.

5. **Trim Spaces**:
   - Use the `TRIM()` function to remove extra spaces from text entries.

6. **Correct Errors**:
   - Identify common errors and correct them manually or using Excel’s **Find and Replace** feature.

7. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Use statistical methods (e.g., calculating Z-scores) to identify and evaluate outliers.

8. **Text Functions**:
   - Use functions like `CONCATENATE()`, `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, and `MID()` for string manipulation and to combine or split text as needed.

9. **Data Sorting and Filtering**:
   - Sort and filter data to better visualize and manage entries for cleaning purposes.

10. **Final Review**:
   - After cleaning and standardization, review the dataset to ensure it meets the desired quality standards.

By following these steps, enhanced the quality and usability of data for analysis in Excel.
